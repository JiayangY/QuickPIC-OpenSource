QuickPIC is a 3D parallel (MPI & OpenMP Hybrid) Quasi-Static PIC code, which is developed based on the framework UPIC. This is the UCLA Plasma Simulation Group's official open-source repository for QuickPIC.

# Upon cloning the repository

If you clone this repository, we ask that you __please contact__ Weiming An (anweiming@ucla.edu). The development of QuickPIC relies on grant funding for which we are required to report code usage, and we would greatly appreciate being able to maintain accurate user-number tallies.
